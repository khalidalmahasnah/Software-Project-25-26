# Parking Management and Guidance System

##1. System Description

### Problem Statement

In high-density environments such as universities, shopping malls, and city centers, finding a parking space fast is really frustrating and inefficient. Drivers waste alot of time and fuel circling lots searching for open spots, which contributes to traffic congestion and increased carbon emissions.

Currently, most parking facilities rely on manual management or outdated legacy systems. These systems suffer from several critical issues:
1.  **Lack of Visibility:** Drivers dont know if a spot is available before arriving.
2.  **Inefficient Entry/Exit:** Manual ticketing and cash payments create bottlenecks at gates.
3.  **Poor Management Data:** Administrators lack real-time insights into occupancy rates, making it difficult to optimize pricing or manage peak hours effectively.

There is an urgent need for an integrated **Parking Management and Guidance System** that leverages IoT sensors and mobile technology to automate access, streamline payments, and guide users to available spots in real-time.
