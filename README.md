# Group 05 - Parking Management and Guidance System

**Princess Sumaya University for Technology**
**Department of Computer Science — Software Engineering Course (13477)**

## Project Overview
An embedded and database-driven system designed to monitor and optimize parking lot usage across various environments such as campuses, malls, airports, or city centers. The system integrates IoT sensors, cameras, and user interfaces to detect vehicle presence, track parking availability, and manage payments in real time.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

### 📂 `/docs` - Documentation
This folder contains the core project deliverables and reports:
* **`report.md`**: The main project report containing the **System Description**. It includes:
    * Problem Statement & Stakeholders.
    * Functional & Non-Functional Requirements.
    * Assumptions.
    * Embedded UML Diagrams.
* **`Diagram_Explanations.pdf`**: A detailed reference document containing:
    * Text explanations for every diagram used in the project.
    * **Comprehensive Tabular Descriptions** for the Use Case diagrams (Goals, Preconditions, Postconditions, and Scenarios).
* **`report.pdf`**: The PDF version of the final report (generated from Markdown).

### 📂 `/uml` - Diagram Source Code
This folder contains the **PlantUML (.puml)** source code files for all diagrams. These files define the structure and behavior of the system models:
* `context_model.puml`
* `activity_*.puml` (Entry, Exit, Reservation, Admin flows)
* `sequence_*.puml` (Interaction flows)
* `use_case_*.puml` (Actor interactions)

## Tools & Workflow
* **Visual Studio Code**: Primary editor.
* **PlantUML**: Used for generating all UML diagrams.
* **Pandoc**: Used for converting Markdown reports to PDF.
